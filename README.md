# main.py Notes

In main.py, the parameters are given at the top and the program should run in the same order.

Local directories are saved the in the dictionary. Some cached files are saved for testing and checking.

Part 1 can be run in one time. But may have to run again due to closed remote network connection.

Part 2, note that the parameters of threshold in *getMedianWithinThreshhold()* is retrived from plots generated by *getThresholdRTTForWeek()* and *pd.getThresholdRTTFreqOfWeek()*.

# Test Guideline:
### Module download_dataset:
1. get valid dates
2. update dict_dates
3. collect dataset
4. Unzip
5. ReadWarts
6. MapKey

### Module process_dataset:
1. get rid of self-loop
2. get node freqency
3. get node set
4. get subset by given node set
5. get plots for t
6. get dataset of median within threshhold
7. get CSV file to feed in model
8. check connectivity
## To Test selected method
Uncomment and run **unit_test.py** -> Module -> Step

Note:
- You can uncomment the required module in line 77 and 78.
- The numbered steps for each module is listed in *testForDownloadDataset* and *testForProcessDataset* with description of each method. You can uncomment the required step which is *tdd/tpd*.*()

## To feed the parameters for given function
**UnitTest** folder -> **testfor_download_dataset.py** and **testfor_process_dataset.py** -> *testForSomething()*
